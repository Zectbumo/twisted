When interrupted with control-C, `trial -j` no longer obscures tracebacks for
any errors caused by that interruption with an `UnboundLocalError` due to a bug
in its own implementation.  Note that there are still several internal
tracebacks that will be emitted upon exiting, because tearing down the test
runner mid-suite is still not an entirely clean operation, but it should at
least be possible to see errors reported from, for example, a test that is
hanging more clearly.
